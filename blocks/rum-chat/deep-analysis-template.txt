CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE, TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE REPORT (TOTAL TARGET: 2000 WORDS FOR DETAILED ANALYSIS):

<b>üìÖ Analysis Period & Data Scope</b>
This comprehensive analysis covers data for the selected time period (provided in the DATA TIME PERIOD section above). All findings, metrics, and recommendations are based on this specific timeframe. ALWAYS include the date range context throughout your analysis to provide proper temporal context for all insights. When presenting any metrics or findings, clearly state that they represent the specified time period (e.g., "over the last 30 days" or "during the past 7 days").

<b>‚ö†Ô∏è Core Web Vitals Interpretation Guidelines</b>
When analyzing LCP, CLS, and INP metrics throughout this analysis:
- If metric titles contain "and rising" or "and falling", these indicate TRENDS, not absolute performance
- "Rising" means the metric is getting worse over time, "falling" means it's improving
- DO NOT conclude the site is bad based solely on "rising" trends - consider the actual metric values
- Focus on the current metric values and their impact, not just the trend direction
- A metric can be "rising" but still within acceptable performance thresholds
- Provide balanced analysis that considers both current performance and trend implications

<b>üîç Comprehensive Facet Analysis Guidelines</b>
For ALL facets being analyzed throughout this comprehensive report:
- ALWAYS check the title field of each facet (found in the help link's title attribute) to understand what it represents and its business purpose
- Use these descriptive titles to provide meaningful context and derive actionable insights
- DO NOT focus primarily on performance metrics - provide balanced, comprehensive analysis across ALL available facets
- Include detailed analysis from: user behavior patterns, traffic acquisition channels, content engagement metrics, error patterns, geographic/demographic distributions, device/browser usage, and any other available data facets
- Each facet provides unique business intelligence - ensure thorough coverage and cross-facet correlation analysis
- Prioritize insights based on business impact, not just technical performance

<b>üåê Site Profile & Overview</b>
START with a clear, prominent statement of the specific date range being analyzed (e.g., "This comprehensive analysis examines the LAST 30 DAYS of data for..." or "Based on the PAST 7 DAYS of data, this appears to be..."). The timeframe must be in the FIRST sentence. Write a comprehensive narrative analysis describing what type of website this appears to be based on the data patterns, traffic composition, and user behavior metrics for the analyzed period. Use the title fields of all available facets to understand their meaning and purpose. Analyze the traffic volume, user engagement patterns, geographic distribution, and technology usage to characterize the site's purpose and audience. Include insights about how users interact with the platform and overall user experience quality during this timeframe. Use flowing paragraphs with embedded key metrics rather than bullet lists. DO NOT assume specific organizations or make up company names - base conclusions only on data patterns. Ensure you reference insights from ALL available facets, not just performance metrics.

CRITICAL: Your OPENING sentence must clearly state the date range (e.g., "This comprehensive deep-dive analysis covers the last 30 days of RUM data for...").
