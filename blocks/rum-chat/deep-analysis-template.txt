EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (follow this HTML formatting exactly):
<b>üåê Site Profile & User Experience Overview</b>
This appears to be a <b>content-rich documentation platform</b> serving developers and technical users. The site processes <span style="color: #28a745; font-weight: bold;">189M monthly visits</span> with users primarily seeking technical resources and guides. <b>Traffic composition</b> shows <span style="color: #28a745; font-weight: bold;">65% desktop usage</span> indicating professional/work-related access patterns, while <b>user engagement</b> reveals <span style="color: #28a745; font-weight: bold;">average session durations of 4.2 minutes</span> with high scroll depth on documentation pages. However, <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">performance bottlenecks</span> are creating friction points that impact user productivity and satisfaction, particularly affecting the developer community who expect fast, responsive interfaces for their workflow.

<b>üö® Critical Findings</b>
- <b>Performance bottleneck (<span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">Critical Risk</span>):</b> GIF-based LCP elements increase load time by <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">2.3s</span>, causing <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">15% conversion loss and $450K annual revenue impact</span>
- <b>Attribution blindness (<span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">High Risk</span>):</b> <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">99.5% of traffic lacks UTM tracking</span>, creating marketing optimization opportunity loss worth <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">$320K annually</span>
- <b>Infrastructure scalability (<span style="color: #ffc107; font-weight: bold;">Medium Risk</span>):</b> CDN configuration suboptimal for <span style="color: #ffc107; font-weight: bold;">40% of global traffic</span>, affecting user experience in key markets
- <b>Mobile performance gap (<span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">High Risk</span>):</b> <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">60% slower load times on mobile devices</span> impacting 35% of user base

<b>‚ö° Performance Deep Dive</b>
Comprehensive technical analysis reveals <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">critical performance bottlenecks</span> across multiple system layers that significantly impact user experience. The most concerning issue involves <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">LCP performance</span>, where GIF-based elements are increasing load time by <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">2.3 seconds</span> across 40% of page views, creating substantial delays for users accessing documentation. Additionally, <span style="color: #ffc107; font-weight: bold;">layout shifts in the header navigation</span> are causing CLS optimization gaps that disrupt user interactions, while <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">JavaScript blocking</span> the main thread for an average of <span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">180ms during peak traffic periods</span> results in noticeable FID response delays that affect the site's perceived responsiveness.
