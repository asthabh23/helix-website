CREATE A STRUCTURED, SCANNABLE EXECUTIVE-LEVEL REPORT:

‚ö†Ô∏è FORMAT REQUIREMENT - USE BULLETS, NOT PARAGRAPHS:
- DO NOT write dense paragraphs of text
- Use CLEAR HEADINGS with bold labels (e.g., <b>Performance & Technical</b>)
- Use BULLET POINTS (‚Ä¢) for all content
- DO NOT use emojis in the report output
- DO NOT use progress bars
- Make the report EASY TO SCAN with clear structure and specific numbers

‚ö†Ô∏è CORE STRUCTURE - SYSTEMATIC FACET COVERAGE:
- You will receive a COMPLETE LIST of all facets that were analyzed (typically 30+ facets)
- Group related facets into natural categories and cover ALL of them in flowing bullet points
- Go through the list SYSTEMATICALLY - don't skip any facet
- Write naturally about multiple related facets together, not mechanically one-by-one
- Balance positives and improvements in a conversational tone
- This ensures ALL facets get coverage without mechanical repetition
- Standard report: 1200-1400 words covering all facets
- With forms data: 1400-1600 words (forms section + all other facets)

‚ö†Ô∏è FORMS DATA PRIORITY:
If fill_source, formsubmit_source, or formsubmit_target tools are available:
- Forms section is MANDATORY and HIGH PRIORITY
- Create dedicated forms section immediately after Executive Summary
- Then continue with balanced facet coverage for all other facets

<b>üìÖ Analysis Period</b>
This analysis covers data for the selected time period (provided in the DATA TIME PERIOD section above). ALWAYS include the specific date range context in your findings. When presenting insights, clearly state that the data represents the specified time period (e.g., "last 30 days" or "last 7 days").

<b>‚ö†Ô∏è Core Web Vitals Interpretation Guidelines</b>
When analyzing LCP, CLS, and INP metrics:
- If metric titles contain "and rising" or "and falling", these indicate TRENDS, not absolute performance
- "Rising" means the metric is getting worse over time, "falling" means it's improving
- DO NOT conclude the site is bad based solely on "rising" trends - consider the actual metric values
- Focus on the current metric values and their impact, not just the trend direction
- A metric can be "rising" but still within acceptable performance thresholds

<b>üîç Facet Analysis Guidelines</b>
For ALL facets being analyzed:
- ALWAYS check the title field of each facet (found in the help link's title attribute) to understand what it represents and its purpose
- Use these descriptive titles to provide context and meaning to your insights and recommendations
- DO NOT focus primarily on performance metrics - provide balanced analysis across ALL available facets
- Include insights from user behavior, traffic acquisition, content engagement, errors, and other non-performance facets
- Each facet provides unique business value - ensure comprehensive coverage of all data types

<b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b>
Create a STRUCTURED, SCANNABLE summary (MAXIMUM 200 words) using this format:

<b>Analysis Period:</b> [Date range] - Start with this as the very first line

<b>Site Status:</b> [1-2 sentence overall health assessment with specific metrics]

<b>Top 3 Critical Findings:</b>
1. [Finding with specific numbers and metrics]
2. [Finding with specific numbers and metrics]
3. [Finding with specific numbers and metrics]

<b>Top 3 Priority Actions:</b>
1. [Action with expected ROI/impact]
2. [Action with expected ROI/impact]
3. [Action with expected ROI/impact]

<b>Overall Recommendation:</b> [Fix/Optimize/Monitor decision with brief rationale]

‚ö†Ô∏è EXCLUDE FORMS: If forms data is provided, forms get their own dedicated section. DO NOT mention forms in Executive Summary.

‚ö†Ô∏è FORMAT: Use the exact structure shown above with bold labels and numbered lists for easy scanning. NO EMOJIS in output.

<b>FORMS INTERACTION & CONVERSION ANALYSIS</b>
‚ö†Ô∏è DEDICATED FORMS SECTION (ONLY IF FORMS DATA IS PROVIDED) ‚ö†Ô∏è

If forms data is provided in the "FORMS DATA" section above:
- CREATE THIS DEDICATED SECTION immediately after Executive Summary
- Analyze forms conversion funnel using the provided fill.source, formsubmit.source, formsubmit.target data
- This section should be 200-300 words
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT mention forms anywhere else in the report
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Forms analysis belongs ONLY in this dedicated section
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All other sections (Executive Summary, Key Metrics, Priority Actions, Business Impact) should focus on NON-FORM facets

<b>Required Analysis (USE THE TOOLS FIRST):</b>
1. CALL fill_source tool with operation: "analyze" to get form entry pages
2. CALL formsubmit_source tool with operation: "analyze" to get form submission pages  
3. CALL formsubmit_target tool with operation: "analyze" to get post-submission destinations

<b>Then provide structured analysis using this format:</b>

<b>Conversion Funnel Overview:</b>
‚Ä¢ Fill events: [count] | Submissions: [count] | Conversion rate: [X%]
‚Ä¢ Drop-off rate: [percentage] abandon before submission

<b>Top Entry Pages (fill.source):</b>
‚Ä¢ [Page name]: [X] fills, [Y%] conversion rate
‚Ä¢ [Page name]: [X] fills, [Y%] conversion rate

<b>Form Performance (formsubmit.source):</b>
‚Ä¢ [+] Best performer: [Form/page] with [X%] completion rate
‚Ä¢ [-] Needs improvement: [Form/page] with [Y%] completion rate

<b>Post-Submission Flow (formsubmit.target):</b>
‚Ä¢ [Destination]: [X] redirects, [success/error page analysis]

<b>Performance Impact:</b>
‚Ä¢ [Specific finding about load time vs form completion with numbers]

<b>Priority Fixes:</b>
‚Ä¢ [Top recommendation with expected impact]
‚Ä¢ [Second recommendation with expected impact]

Use this structured bullet format with specific metrics. This section should be 200-300 words when forms data is available.

<b>KEY METRICS & FINDINGS</b>
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - SYSTEMATIC COVERAGE OF ALL NON-FORM FACETS:

‚ö†Ô∏è USE THE FACET LIST: Above in the dashboard data, you received a "COMPLETE LIST OF ALL FACETS THAT MUST BE COVERED" - this is your checklist.

‚ö†Ô∏è EXCLUDE FORMS: If forms data was provided, it's already covered in the dedicated forms section above. DO NOT mention forms here.

Create NATURAL, FLOWING insights organized by category that cover ALL NON-FORM facets from the provided list. Ensure complete coverage but write in a connected, narrative style.

<b>How to ensure complete coverage:</b>
- Group related facets into clear categories with bold headings (e.g., <b>Performance & Technical</b>, <b>Traffic & Acquisition</b>, <b>User Behavior & Engagement</b>, <b>Content Performance</b>, <b>Errors & Technical Issues</b>)
- Within each category, write 2-4 bullet points that naturally discuss the facets in that group
- Each bullet should flow naturally, mentioning multiple related facets together with specific metrics
- Balance positives and areas for improvement in a natural conversational tone
- Cross off each facet mentally as you cover it to ensure nothing is missed

<b>Writing Style:</b>
- Use CLEAR CATEGORY HEADINGS with <b>bold labels</b>
- Use BULLET POINTS (‚Ä¢) within each category
- Write in a NATURAL, CONVERSATIONAL flow - NOT mechanical [+]/[-] format
- Discuss multiple related facets together in each bullet point
- Use specific numbers and metrics from the actual data
- Keep bullets concise but natural (2-3 sentences per bullet)
- NO EMOJIS in the report content
- NO progress bars

<b>Coverage Checklist (organize these NON-FORM facets into natural categories):</b>
- Performance metrics (LCP, CLS, INP, TTFB, etc.)
- Traffic patterns and acquisition sources
- User behavior and engagement
- Content performance
- Error patterns and technical issues
- Geographic distribution
- Device and browser usage
- Navigation patterns
- Checkpoints and user journey events
- Resource loading
- Media interactions
- Any other NON-FORM facets that were analyzed

‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER: Skip fill.source, formsubmit.source, formsubmit.target - these are covered in the dedicated forms section.

Write in this natural, flowing style with category headings and bullet points that cover multiple related facets together. Use actual data and ensure ALL facets from the provided list are covered.

<b>PRIORITY ACTION PLAN</b>
