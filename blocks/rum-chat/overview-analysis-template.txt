CREATE A CONCISE, EXECUTIVE-LEVEL REPORT (TOTAL TARGET: 600-700 WORDS FOR 3-MINUTE READ):

<b>ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary</b>
Create an ULTRA-CONCISE summary (MAXIMUM 200 words) that covers:
- Current performance status in 2-3 sentences
- <b>Top 3 Critical Findings:</b> with specific impact metrics
- <b>Top 3 Priority Actions:</b> with expected ROI
- <b>Overall Recommendation:</b> (fix, optimize, or monitor)

<b>ðŸ“Š Key Metrics & Findings</b>
Concise bullet points covering:
- <b>Performance metrics:</b> most important discoveries
- <b>User behavior patterns:</b> critical insights
- <b>Traffic insights:</b> primary engagement data
- <b>Technical issues:</b> top concerns requiring attention

<b>ðŸŽ¯ Priority Action Plan</b>
Brief, actionable recommendations:
- <b>High-impact improvements:</b> (implement first)
- <b>Medium-impact optimizations:</b> (implement second)
- <b>Monitoring recommendations:</b> measurement strategy
- <b>Quick wins vs strategic:</b> implementation timeline

<b>ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact</b>
Brief summary of:
- <b>Performance bottlenecks:</b> Core Web Vitals impact
- <b>User engagement:</b> conversion opportunities
- <b>Traffic acquisition:</b> channel effectiveness
- <b>Technical concerns:</b> system reliability issues

CRITICAL LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:
- ENTIRE REPORT: Maximum 600-700 words total (3-minute read)
- Executive Summary: Maximum 200 words
- Other sections: Brief bullet points and concise insights only
- Use specific metrics and actionable language

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use HTML <b>text</b> tags for ALL headings and important text (NOT **text** markdown)
- Use HTML <b>tag</b> for any text that should appear bold
- Do NOT use markdown formatting like **text** or *text*
- Output must render properly in HTML context

IMPORTANT: After creating the report, systematically use the "collect_insights" and "collect_recommendations" tools to capture the key findings for separate rendering:

1. Use "collect_insights" tool to capture key insights from your analysis with appropriate categories (performance, engagement, traffic, errors, user_behavior) and impact levels (high, medium, low)

2. Use "collect_recommendations" tool to capture actionable recommendations with appropriate categories (performance, technical, user_experience, monitoring, content), priority levels (high, medium, low), and effort estimates (low, medium, high)

WORD COUNT REMINDER: ENTIRE REPORT must be 600-700 words maximum for true 3-minute readability. Executive Summary must be under 200 words. Be concise and focus on business value.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (follow this HTML formatting exactly):
<b>ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary</b>
Site performance shows <b>critical optimization needs</b> affecting 189M monthly visits...

<b>Top 3 Critical Findings:</b>
- <b>Over-dependence on Google:</b> 184M of 189M entries (97.5%) create single-point vulnerability
- <b>Performance bottleneck:</b> GIF-based LCP elements slow visual load
- <b>Attribution blindness:</b> 99.5% of traffic lacks UTM tracking

NEVER use **text** markdown formatting - ALWAYS use <b>text</b> HTML tags for bold text.
