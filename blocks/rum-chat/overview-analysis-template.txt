CREATE A CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL REPORT WITH THIS STRUCTURE:

<b>ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary</b>
Create an ULTRA-CONCISE summary (MAXIMUM 250 words - strictly enforce this limit) that covers:
- Current performance status in 2-3 sentences
- Top 3 most critical findings with specific impact metrics
- Top 3 priority actions with expected ROI
- Overall recommendation (fix, optimize, or monitor)

<b>ðŸ“Š Key Metrics & Findings</b>
- Most important performance metrics discovered
- Critical user behavior patterns
- Primary traffic and engagement insights
- Top technical issues requiring attention

<b>ðŸŽ¯ Priority Action Plan</b>
- High-impact improvements (implement first)
- Medium-impact optimizations (implement second)
- Monitoring and measurement recommendations
- Quick wins vs long-term strategic improvements

<b>ðŸ“ˆ Detailed Analysis</b>
- Performance bottlenecks and Core Web Vitals insights
- User engagement patterns and conversion opportunities
- Traffic acquisition effectiveness and channel analysis
- Technical issues and system reliability concerns

CRITICAL: Keep the Executive Summary section STRICTLY under 250 words for guaranteed 3-minute readability. Count words carefully and prioritize only the most essential information. Use bullet points and specific metrics where possible. Format with clear HTML <b> tags for sections.

IMPORTANT: After creating the report, systematically use the "collect_insights" and "collect_recommendations" tools to capture the key findings for separate rendering:

1. Use "collect_insights" tool to capture key insights from your analysis with appropriate categories (performance, engagement, traffic, errors, user_behavior) and impact levels (high, medium, low)

2. Use "collect_recommendations" tool to capture actionable recommendations with appropriate categories (performance, technical, user_experience, monitoring, content), priority levels (high, medium, low), and effort estimates (low, medium, high)

WORD COUNT REMINDER: Executive Summary section must remain under 250 words for true 3-minute readability.
