Use actual data from your analysis. Extract real metrics from the dashboard and calculate realistic business opportunities.

IMPORTANT: Base ALL analysis on real data present on the dashboard. Do not use hypothetical examples or placeholder values. Only report findings that you can verify from the actual dashboard data provided.

PERFORMANCE SCORE INTERPRETATION: When performance scores (like Core Web Vitals) are missing or not displayed for certain pages/segments, this indicates insufficient sample size to calculate reliable scores, NOT missing performance data. In your analysis:
- Note which pages/segments have sufficient traffic for performance scoring
- Identify low-traffic pages that lack performance scores due to sample size
- Focus performance analysis on segments with adequate data
- Don't conclude that "performance data is missing" when scores aren't shown
